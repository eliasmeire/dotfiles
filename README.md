## Installation

### Run setup.sh

Please read through the `setup.sh` script and comment out parts you don't want.

The script will backup your home directory to `~/home-backup`. After that it will copy the dotfiles and setup all the tools.

```shell
./setup.sh
```

⚠️ VSCode, iTerm and Homebrew should be installed before running their `setup.sh`
